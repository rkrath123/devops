Security
=========
In the video, we had seen how the sample kubeconfig file was making use of certificates for authentication. 
Depending on the service provider, the provider can use any of the authentication modes, it can be certificates, tokens, etc.

In the older Digital Ocean based K8s cluster, the kubeconfig file used certificates. However, the newer one makes use of bearer tokens.

Replace the IP and Token in the below command based on your environment

curl -k https://IP-HERE:/api/v1/ --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
