Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding hashicorp/google versions matching "3.85.0"...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/local from the dependency lock file
- Installing hashicorp/google v3.85.0...
- Installed hashicorp/google v3.85.0 (signed by HashiCorp)
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/local v2.2.3

Terraform has made some changes to the provider dependency selections recorded
in the .terraform.lock.hcl file. Review those changes and commit them to your 
version control system if they represent changes you intended to make.        

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see  
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands  
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,      
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

These credentials will be used by any library that requests Application Default Credentials (ADC).

Quota project "vsha-ramakant-3568233425114030" was added to ADC which can be used by Google client libraries for billing and quota.
Note that some services may still bill the project owning the resource.


Updates are available for some Google Cloud CLI components.  To install them,
please run:
  $ gcloud components update



To take a quick anonymous survey, run:

terraform {

terraform plan
------------

PS C:\Users\rathram\OneDrive - Hewlett Packard Enterprise\terraform\first-tf-script> terraform  plan 

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create


  # google_storage_bucket.GCS1 will be created
  + resource "google_storage_bucket" "GCS1" {
      + force_destroy               = false
      + id                          = (known after apply)
      + location                    = "US"
      + name                        = "bucket-ramakant123"
      + project                     = (known after apply)
      + public_access_prevention    = (known after apply)
      + self_link                   = (known after apply)
      + storage_class               = "STANDARD"
      + uniform_bucket_level_access = (known after apply)
      + url                         = (known after apply)

      + versioning {
          + enabled = (known after apply)
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

 

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.

terraform  apply
------------------
PS C:\Users\rathram\OneDrive - Hewlett Packard Enterprise\terraform\first-tf-script> terraform  apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_storage_bucket.GCS1 will be created
  + resource "google_storage_bucket" "GCS1" {
      + force_destroy               = false
      + id                          = (known after apply)
      + location                    = "US"
      + name                        = "bucket-ramakant123"
      + project                     = (known after apply)
      + public_access_prevention    = (known after apply)
      + self_link                   = (known after apply)
      + storage_class               = "STANDARD"
      + uniform_bucket_level_access = (known after apply)
      + url                         = (known after apply)

      + versioning {
          + enabled = (known after apply)
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

terrafor destroy
---------------

PS C:\Users\rathram\OneDrive - Hewlett Packard Enterprise\terraform\first-tf-script> terraform  destroy
google_storage_bucket.GCS1: Refreshing state... [id=bucket-ramakant123]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_storage_bucket.GCS1 will be destroyed
  - resource "google_storage_bucket" "GCS1" {
      - default_event_based_hold    = false -> null
      - force_destroy               = false -> null
      - id                          = "bucket-ramakant123" -> null
      - labels                      = {} -> null
      - location                    = "US" -> null

      - url                         = "gs://bucket-ramakant123" -> null
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

google_storage_bucket.GCS1: Destroying... [id=bucket-ramakant123]
google_storage_bucket.GCS1: Destruction complete after 2s

Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.

```
