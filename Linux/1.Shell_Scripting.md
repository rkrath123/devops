Introduction to Variables
==========================
Learn How to Automate Common Tasks with Bash Shell Scripting
-------------------------------------------------------------
```
 Variables are useful to store data in shell scripts and Later we can use them if they required.

 Simple Variable: x=4
 Default value of a variable is Empty/Nothing
 
 In Linux Shell Scripting, there are two types of variables:
 
 System Variables:
 Created and maintained by Operating System itself.
 This type of variables are defined in CAPITAL LETTERS.
 We can see them by using set command
 Example: HOME, USER…
 
 User Defined Variables:
 Created and maintained by the user.
 This type of variables are defined in lower letters.
 But we can also take combination of upper and lower case letters.
 
Rules to Define User Defined Variables
-----------------------------------------
Learn How to Automate Common Tasks with Bash Shell Scripting
 Variable Name should contain only a-z or A-Z, 0-9 and _ characters.
 Variable Name length should be less than or equal to 20 characters.
 Variable Names are case sensitive. Means x and X are different.
 Don’t Provide space on either sides of equal symbol while defining variables
 Ex: x=4 is valid
 x =4 or x = 4 or x= 4 are invalid
 No need to declare variable type, Automatically it will take care while executing commands or scripts.
 Use quotes for the data if data consist of spaces
 
 We can store the output of a command into a variable as follows:
 
 anyVariable=$(command)
 anyVariable=`command`
 
 We can assign one variable value/data into another using:
 
 Name=“Shell Scripting”
 NewName=$Name
 NewName=${Name}

[root@veena ~]# set | grep BASH

echo "The Docker version is:$docker_version"
echo "Docker status is :" $docker_status

[root@veena ~]# bash 1.sh
The Docker version is:18.09.1
Docker status is : running

```
Advance usesage of echo
=======================
```
 echo command is used to display string/message or variable value or command result.
 Simple syntax:
 echo message/string
 echo “message/string”
 echo “message/string with some variable $xyz”
 echo “message/string/$variable/$(command)”
 Advanced usage (to execute escape characters):
 echo -e
“Message/String or variable”
 Escape Characters:
 \n New Line
 \t Horizantal Tab
 \v Vertical Tab
 \b Backspace
 \r Carriage Return etc…
 To display message in colors.
 echo -n
“message/string/$variable/$(command)”

Practical
---------
[root@veena ~]# y=5

[root@veena ~]# echo "the value of y:$y"
the value of y:5

[root@veena ~]# echo "the current user is `whoami`"
the current user is root

[root@veena ~]# echo "the current user is $(whoami)"
the current user is root
[root@veena ~]#

multiline in single statement
[root@veena ~]# echo -e "first line \n2nd line"
first line
2nd line

[root@veena ~]# echo -e "first line \v2nd line"
first line
           2nd line
[root@veena ~]# echo -e "first line \r2nd line"  #crusor will come to first position because of \r and it will print from their
2nd linene

[root@veena ~]# echo -e "this is my \"bash\" script "
this is my "bash" script
```

Multiline Block
------------------
```
Heredoc is very useful to write multi-lines or multiline block.
 Note: Here DELIMITER can be any string
 Heredoc is mostly used with the combination of cat command.
 Display multi-lines using cat command.

cat << DELIMITER >demo.txt
line 1
line2
DELIMITER

cat <<EOF | tee /etc/yum.repos.d/elasticsearch.repo
[elasticsearch-7.x]
name=Elasticsearch repository for 7.x packages
EOF

cat > 1.sh <<EOF
date
hostnamectl
EOF

cat <<EOF > print.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo \$PWD
echo $PWD
EOF
```

HERE String
==========
```

[root@veena ~]# echo "This Ramakant"
This Ramakant
[root@veena ~]# echo "This Ramakant" | tr [A-Z] [a-z]
this ramakant
[root@veena ~]# tr [A-Z] [a-z] <<< "This Ramakant"
this ramakant
[root@veena ~]# name="This Ramakant"
[root@veena ~]# tr [A-Z] [a-z] <<< $name
this ramakant
[root@veena ~]# tr [A-Z] [a-z] <<< $(docker -v)
docker version 18.09.1, build 4c52b90
[root@veena ~]#
[root@veena ~]# tr [A-Z] [a-z] <<< `docker -v`
docker version 18.09.1, build 4c52b90

echo "done script"

```
Make Bash script portable 
------------------------
```
shibang line- which shell we are uisig to execute our script
  #!/bin/bash <--shibang line this path may not present with different os
  
  to make portable every os
  #!/usr/bin/env bash 
  
```
Debugging Bash Shell Scripts
============================
```
Debugging is determining the cause which fails the script.
 Why script fails ?

 Because of some errors.

 This is because of two type of errors.
 Syntax Errors
 Runtime Errors

 Syntax Errors stops script execution and run time errors don’t stop script.
 Actually we don’t have good debugging procedures with shell scripting, but we can try with some
commands.
 And there are different commands for debugging and we will work with set command.
 One more thing our bash is an interpreter

 We can go with set command and We have different options with set command.
 Syntax:
 set [options]

 No Options: To list system defined variables
 set -n No Execution, Purely for syntax check.
 set -x Prints the command before executing it in script
 set -e Exit Script if any command fails

```
Exit Status
===========
```
[root@veena ~]# erge
bash: erge: command not found...
[root@veena ~]# cmd_rc=$?
[root@veena ~]# echo $cmd_rc
127
[root@veena ~]#

[root@veena ~]# date
Sat Oct 22 16:23:47 IST 2022
[root@veena ~]# echo $?
0

0 ->susessfiul
127>command not found
1->command fails during execution
2->incorrect command usage
```
